WScore
======

PHP library/framework for my work.

developed and tested on PHP >= 5.3.

###Statement

WScore is a simple, easy to use, configurable, and reliable
good PHP library for database and business logic development.

All the goodies from PHP5.3, namespace, DiContainer, PDO, etc.
are used in WScore to keep the code clean and simple.

This, hopefully, eases the maintenance of the developed code
over the years of service.

###It's Not a MVC Framework

WScore does not offer any of MVC stuff found in Web Application
Framework. This library aims to build solid business model and
its presentation for html.

Goals

###documents

Trying to implement a Document Driven Development.

write a document first, full of specification, API, and features,
regardless of the state of the development or just a wishes.

###tests

###CUI Rapid Development
